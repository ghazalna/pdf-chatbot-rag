# ðŸ¤– PDF Chatbot with RAG using LangChain & OpenAI

This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot that reads a PDF file, creates embeddings from its content, and allows you to ask questions about the document using OpenAI's GPT model.

---

## ðŸ“š What It Does

- Loads a PDF (e.g., "Prompt Engineering") ðŸ“„
- Converts it into text chunks
- Embeds the chunks using OpenAI embeddings
- Stores them in an in-memory vector store
- Uses a retriever to fetch relevant chunks based on your query
- Uses GPT (`gpt-4o-mini`) to generate answers based on the retrieved context
